    <p>Hey Love,</p>
    <p>
      Looking back at the beautiful journey we’ve shared over these past few years,
      my heart is overflowing with gratitude. It feels like only yesterday we've been
      together, yet I can’t imagine my life without you. I am so deeply happy by your
      side, and my only wish is that we continue to walk through life hand-in-hand, as
      partner and best friends, for all the years to come..
    </p>
     It’s often the smallest things you do that makes me  want to stay with you. 
    You have this way of making me feel so incredibly safe like I’ve finally found my home. 
    Even now, I still get those sweet, nervous butterflies when you’re near. I enjoy the 
    moments when you act a little clingy or playful which makes me feel like I am your comfort 
    zone. And though I love to tease you just to see that cute frustrated look on your face,
    I adore every version of you.
    <p>
      No matter what, remember — you are deeply loved.
    </p>
    Calling you "ทีรัก" is so special to me. It's my way of expressing how deeply connected I feel 
    to you. You are a central part of my world, and my รัก  for you grows stronger with every passing day.
    <p>
      You are the one who finally broke down the walls I had built around me beaucause of that, I can speak
      freely with others.
      I don't know wheather I can impress you or not, but I will try my best to do it. I am boring person 
      actually, but still I will try my best. I am not good at expressing but I hope you understand it.

      There is a strange, sweet comfort even in the way you care for me. No matter how much you hurt me,
      you are the person I will always run to. My anxiety disappears the moment I’m with you. You are my comfort,
      my home, and my greatest joy.
      I could write forever and still not find enough words to tell you how much you mean to me, but I’ll leave it
      here for now. May our lives continue to be a beautiful story of happiness and love.
        </p>
  </p> I love you, my dear Teerak. Always.</p>

  </p> Yours lovely,
Piccolo monella 💗 </p>
